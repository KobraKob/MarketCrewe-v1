- A rugged, bearded lumberjack holding a bar of Dr. Squatch soap, with a cheeky grin, standing in front of a wooden cabin, surrounded by soap suds and forest foliage.

- Shampoo
- A hipster Sasquatch with a majestic mane, washing its hair with Dr. Squatch shampoo under a waterfall, with a silly expression, and a bottle of shampoo floating beside it.
